I kept the app as simple as possible. I made the assumption that if the game ended in a draw (no winner), UI did not need to indicate that- they could just start a new game. Tested on ios and android, portrait and landscape.

ios:

cd ios
pod install
cd ..
npx react-native run-ios

android: (make sure Android Studio is updated)

npx react-native run-android
